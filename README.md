## Streamlit and Its Use-Cases

This repository includes two beginner-level examples of using [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) which:

>Allow you to turn data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes, not weeks. It’s all Python, open-source, and free! And once you’ve created an app you can use our Community Cloud platform to deploy, manage, and share your app.

Using just Python, Streamlit allows a generation of both the back-end and the front-end of an online application or webpage. This means that by writing a few dozens lines of Python code, a developer can create an app that can be served to his colleagues at work, or to anyone across the world.

Streamlit can be limited in functionality and slow. Some of the notable limitations are its lack of design flexibility and control over the application layout. Moreover, if the application and/or dataset is large, there likely be speed issues. This is since the entire source code is being re-run on every new change or interaction.

Streamlit has proved useful for:
1. Serving data analytics dashboards when a user-interaction requires a backend (for instance to serve a model).
2. Presenting proof-of-concepts (POCs) of ML models

However, even with limited capabilities (compared to a backend and frontend built with e.g. Python and React), Streamlit can still allow making a large impact.
